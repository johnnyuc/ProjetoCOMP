# Compilers tutorial IV: Abstract syntax

_Yacc_ is a powerful tool for generating parsers, by transforming formal grammars into executable code. In this tutorial we explore how to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST), which is a kind of parse tree which discards irrelevant details while fully preserving the meaning of the original program.

A bit of theory: A syntax-directed translation (SDT) scheme consists of a grammar with attached program fragments (called _actions_). Whenever a _production_ is used, during syntax analysis, its _action_ is executed. One of the main uses of these schemes is to build syntax trees. Every time a production is used during bottom-up parsing, the corresponding action can _create_ new nodes and/or _relate_ children nodes to the parent.

## Abstract syntax trees

Trees can be represented in a number of ways. The data structures below specify that a _node_ in the AST has a linked list of _children nodes_:

    struct node {
        enum category category;
        char *token;
        struct node_list *children;
    };

    struct node_list {
        struct node *node;
        struct node_list *next;
    };

Every node has a syntactic _category_ denoting a specific programming construct occurring in the input program, such as a function, a parameter declaration, or a natural constant:

    enum category {Program, Function, ..., Identifier, Natural, ...};

Every node also includes a pointer to the original _token_. The token is necessary because a node of category ``Identifier`` must have the name of the function or variable, a node of category ``Natural`` must have the string of digits representing the natural constant, and so on.

To build an AST we only need two operations: creating a new node and adding a child node to a parent node. Two functions provide that functionality:

    struct node *newnode(enum category category, char *token);
    void addchild(struct node *parent, struct node *child);

The first function returns a newly allocated node with all its fields initialized (including an empty list of children). The second function appends a node to the list of children of the parent node. They are provided in files [``ast.h``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/ast.h) and [``ast.c``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/ast.c).

## Syntax-directed translation

During bottom-up parsing, an action ``{...}`` is executed when the corresponding production is used. The combined result of all those executions is the AST.

Consider the following _yacc_ specification (which you will complete). Notice that it is included in file [``petit.y``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/petit.y), that you should carefully analyze.

    program: IDENTIFIER '(' parameters ')' '=' expression
                    { $$ = program = newnode(Program, NULL);
                      struct node *function = newnode(Function, NULL);
                      addchild(function, newnode(Identifier, $1));
                      addchild(function, $3);
                      addchild(function, $6);
                      addchild($$, function); }
        ;
    parameters: parameter               { /* ... */ }
        | parameters ',' parameter      { /* ... */ }
        ;
    parameter: INTEGER IDENTIFIER       { /* ... */ }
        | DOUBLE IDENTIFIER             { /* ... */ }
        ;
    arguments: expression               { /* ... */ }
        | arguments ',' expression      { /* ... */ }
        ;
    expression: IDENTIFIER              { /* ... */ }
        | NATURAL                       { $$ = newnode(Natural, $1); }
        | DECIMAL                       { /* ... */ }
        | IDENTIFIER '(' arguments ')'  { /* ... */ }
        | IF expression THEN expression ELSE expression  %prec LOW
                                        { /* ... */ }
        | expression '+' expression     { /* ... */ }
        | expression '-' expression     { /* ... */ }
        | expression '*' expression     { /* ... */ }
        | expression '/' expression     { /* ... */ }
        | '(' expression ')'            { $$ = $2; }  
        ;

When the first production is used, the right-hand side contains a _function_ with its ``parameters`` and ``expression``. Parsing will be finishing there. The corresponding action executes 6 statements, in the following order: _(1)_ the AST's root node ``Program`` is created; _(2)_ a new ``Function`` node is created; _(3)_ a new ``Identifier`` node is created, with the function name, and becomes a child of the ``Function`` node; _(4)_ the ``parameters`` node ``$3`` becomes a child of the ``Function`` node; _(5)_ the ``expression`` node ``$6`` becomes a child of the ``Function`` node; and _(6)_ the new ``Function`` node becomes a child of the ``Program`` node.

# Token types and ``%union``

As seen in the previous tutorial, the semantic value of a token must be stored in global variable ``yylval``, which has type ``int`` by default. Token declarations use:

    %token INTEGER DOUBLE IF THEN ELSE

When we need to use multiple data types, the ``%union`` declaration allows us to specify the distinct types that might be stored in ``yylval``. In our case:

    %union{
        char *lexeme;
        struct node *node;
    }

This ``%union`` declaration modifies the type of ``yylval`` so that it may hold a _lexeme_ (``char *``) or a _node_ (``struct node *``). In other words, ``yylval`` might be a string or an AST node, and a C union encapsulates the two alternatives.

Then, when we declare a token, the C type is specified as follows:

    %token<lexeme> IDENTIFIER NATURAL DECIMAL

Identifiers, naturals and decimals require their semantic value (the ``char *`` to the original string) to be stored. The _lex_ specification should copy the semantic value by executing ``yylval.lexeme = strdup(yytext);`` before returning any of these tokens.

Furthermore, syntactic variables (i.e., nonterminals) are specified using the ``%type`` declaration:

    %type<node> program parameters parameter arguments expression

This way, the type of ``$$``, ``$1``, ``$2``, etc., is correctly handled during parsing.

## Exercises

Begin by carefully examining the file [``petit.y``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/petit.y) and the AST construction functions in files [``ast.h``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/ast.h) and [``ast.c``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/ast.c).

1. Complete the actions marked with ``/* ... */`` so that an AST is constructed, for each program, using the supplied functions ``newnode(...)`` and ``addchild(...)``.

2. Write a function to recursively traverse the AST and show its content. The goal is to call that function immediately after ``yyparse()`` to check that the AST is correct. Consider the following pseudocode:

```
     show(struct node *node, int depth) {
         print(node->category, node->token, depth)
         foreach child in node->children show(child, depth+1)
     }
```

Taking ``factorial(integer n) = if n then n * factorial(n-1) else 1`` as input, the solution to exercises 1 and 2 should have the following output:

```
  Program
  __Function
  ____Identifier(factorial)
  ____Parameters
  ______Parameter
  ________Integer
  ________Identifier(n)
  ____If
  ______Identifier(n)
  ______Mul
  ________Identifier(n)
  ________Call
  __________Identifier(factorial)
  __________Arguments
  ____________Sub
  ______________Identifier(n)
  ______________Natural(1)
  ______Natural(1)
```

3. Modify the grammar to allow for multiple functions, using the productions that follow, and implement the necessary action to construct the AST.

```
     program: IDENTIFIER '(' parameters ')' '=' expression
            | program IDENTIFIER '(' parameters ')' '=' expression
```

Test your solution with the following example, found in file [``factorial.pt``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/test/factorial.pt):

    factorial(integer n) = if n then n * factorial(n-1) else 1
    main(integer i) = write(factorial(read(0)))

The file [``factorial.ast``](https://github.com/rbbarbosa/Petit/blob/main/tutorial/p4_source/factorial.ast) contains the expected AST for this program.
