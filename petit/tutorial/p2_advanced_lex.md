# Compilers tutorial II: Advanced _lex_ features

_Start conditions_ are used to specify different _states_ in which the lexical analyzer can be, based on specific rules and patterns. Each start condition includes a distinct set of regular expressions that are active when that condition is triggered. By using start conditions, _lex_ allows for more flexible and modular specification of token recognition based on the lexical context.

To declare new start conditions, place their names in the declarations section of the _lex_ source file:

    %X STATE1 STATE2

To use a start condition in the rules section, enclose its name in ``<>`` at the beginning of a rule (the expression is only matched if the automaton is in that state):

    <STATE1>expression    { printf("found expression in state 1"); }

To move _lex_ to a specific start condition, execute ``BEGIN(condition)`` in the action of a rule. To return to the default initial state of _lex_, execute ``BEGIN(INITIAL)`` or simply ``BEGIN(0)``. Notice that you may remove the parentheses and simply write ``BEGIN condition`` and ``BEGIN 0``, if you prefer.

## An example

To exemplify the usage of _lex_ states, consider the following specification:

    %X COMMENT
    %%
    .                       {;}
    "/*"                    { BEGIN(COMMENT); }
    <COMMENT>.              { ECHO; }
    <COMMENT>\n             { printf(" "); }
    <COMMENT>"*/"           { BEGIN(INITIAL); }
    %%
    extern int yylex();
    int main() {
        yylex();
        return 0;
    }
    int yywrap() {
        return 1;
    }

This _lex_ specification ignores everything _except_ comments. We could use this to check the spelling of text in code comments.

The first rule discards any character (except newline). The second rule matches ``/*`` and moves the lexical analyser to the ``COMMENT`` state. In that state, any character (except newline) is printed while newline characters are replaced by spaces. Finally, when the closing ``*/`` is matched, the analyser moves back to the initial state.

## Pre-declared functions and variables

For reference, the following table summarises the most relevant features of _lex_.

| Name                 | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ``int yylex(void)``  | Call the lexical analyser                         |
| ``char *yytext`` 	   | Pointer to the matched token                      |
| ``yyleng``           | Length of the matched token                       |
| ``yylval``           | Semantic value associated with a token            |
| ``YY_USER_ACTION``   | Macro executed before every matched rule's action |
| ``ECHO``             | Print the matched string                          |
| ``int yywrap(void)`` | Called on end-of-file, return 1 to stop           |
| ``BEGIN condition``  | Switch to a specific start condition              |
| ``INITIAL``          | The default initial start condition (same as 0)   |
| ``%X condition(s)``  | Declare the names of exclusive start conditions   |

All of these features should be familiar to _lex_ users. An advanced feature that can simplify _lex_ specifications is the ``YY_USER_ACTION`` macro: if we ``#define`` this macro, the corresponding code will be executed before every single action. Therefore, it is useful when the same code is repeated in all actions.

## Exercises

The following exercises start with _your_ solution to the previous exercises in file ``lexer.l``. Alternatively, you could also use the original ``lexer.l`` file.

1. Many programming languages have block comments delimited by ``/* ... */`` that are allowed to span multiple lines. Modify the lexical analyser to support block comments. Specifically, it should discard all comments while maintaining the line and column numbers correctly updated. For simplicity, unterminated comments are allowed in our miniature programming language.

Test the lexical analyser on the following input:

    factorial(integer n) =
        if n then n * factorial(n-1) else 1  /* recursive factorial
     */ #

The lexer should output the 19 tokens, followed by an error message on line 3, column 5, because ``#`` is an invalid character.

2. Modify the lexical analyser to recognize strings. For example, it should print ``STRLIT("hello\n")`` when given ``"hello\n"`` as input. Strings are sequences of characters (except "carriage return", "newline" and double quotation marks) and/or "escape sequences" delimited by double quotation marks. Escape sequences ``\f``, ``\n``, ``\r``, ``\t``, ``\\`` and ``\"`` are allowed, while any other escape sequences should show an error message like:

    ``Line x, column y: invalid escape sequence (\z)``
